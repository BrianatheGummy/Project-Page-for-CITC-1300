    <h3>Why Theorize About the Timeline?</h3>
    <p> There have been several different horror games over the years, and they all have made their staples in history. There are some that are old and some that are new, but one horror game series has had the same impact on modern horror- the Five Nights at Freddie’s franchise. Even though the original game didn’t have a lot to it, it was something that was different. The lore of the game played a huge part in why it was so popular.

    <p> FNaF burst into the horror scene in 2014 and has stayed an important part of the genre all the way into today- through the main games, the side games, the novels, coloring books and an incredibly popular movie. But one of the most difficult things about the whole franchise is figuring out the order of the story of the pizzeria. The story of Freddie’s is based around the man in the Golden Bonnie suit- William Afton. Afton is the main villain of the whole series in which he murders over a dozen kids. During his murder spree, he discovers the secret to immortal life. Years later, his son, Micheal, is the hero who tries to end his father after he gains immortality by being attacked in the fifth game of the series, Sister Location.

    <p>However the problem with the whole series is the timeline makes little to no sense. The small amount of lore that is seeded out about where and when each game takes place. The books themselves take place in worlds that seem to be parallels to the one in which the game takes place. So theorists of the horror community began to work to try and piece together the whole timeline. But the issue that fans have tried to solve throughout the decade that FNaF has existed is the story that it tells. Trying to piece the puzzles that have been given out. But there are so many issues and problems within solving the series.
