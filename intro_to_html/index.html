<h1>Five Nights At Freddie's Timeline Theories</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Why Theorize About the Timeline?</h2>
<p> There have been several different horror games over the years, and they all have made their staples in history.
    There are some that are old and some that are new, but one horror game series has had the same impact on modern horror- the Five Nights at Freddie’s franchise. 
</p>

<p> FNaF burst into the horror scene in 2014 and has stayed an important part of the genre all the way into today- 
    through the main games, the side games, the novels, coloring books and an incredibly popular movie. But one of the 
    most difficult things about the whole franchise is the story of the pizzeria. 

</p>

<p>The story of Freddie’s is based around the man in the Golden Bonnie suit- William Afton. 
    Afton is the main villain of the whole series in which he murders over a dozen kids. 
    During his murder spree, he discovers the story of immortal life. 
    Years later, his son, Micheal, is the hero who tries to end his father after he gains immortality. 
</p>

<p> However the problem with the whole series is the timeline makes little to no sense. 
    The small amount of lore that is seeded out about where and when each game takes place. 
    The books themselves take place in worlds that seem to be parallels to the one in which the game takes place. 
    So theorists of the horror community began to work to try and piece together the whole timeline. 
</p>

<p>The issue that fans have tried to solve throughout the decade that FNaF has existed is the story that it tells. 
    Trying to piece the puzzles that have been given out. But there are so many issues and problems within solving the series. 
</p>

<p>So what is the timeline issue?</p>

<hr>

<h3> Trouble With Timing</h3>
<p> The timeline starts in what is believed to be roughly 1950’s- due to the more realistic elements, 
    such as the poster for Fredbear's Singing Show- a live dancing bear show, which was a cheap popular 
    entertainment after the Great Depression. For William Afton to start the Freddie’s brand, he would 
    need to have seen the show which he used as inspiration for the diner. So shortly after his success, 
    he merged the knock off version- Chica’s Party World. Which was how he became the business partner for Henry Emily.</p>

    <img src="images/MV5BNDIyYzM5ODMtMDJkNC00Y2EzLWJiMWQtODlkNDllZTZiYmMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI5MTc0OTIy._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg" alt="MV5BNDIyYzM5ODMtMDJkNC00Y2EzLWJiMWQtODlkNDllZTZiYmMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI5MTc0OTIy">
<p> His youngest son’s death is pretty solidly placed in 1983, which led to Afton killing Charlotte “Charlie” Emily 
    outside the diner. This led to Afton going on a murder spree of 5 kids in roughly 1985. But this is where the 
    biggest problem for the FNaF timeline comes in.</p>

<p> Elizabeth Afton- William Aftons’s daughter -dies after getting too close to Baby- an animatronic with a claw used
     to capture kids. However her death logically seems like it would come before the Crying Child’s- the only true best
      fitting name for the youngest Afton as no one has been able to create solid evidence stating his name. This is due 
      to the fact that in FNaF 4- the only game of the originals to not take place at a pizzeria but at a house -Plushie 
      FredBear, whom had a walkie talkie connected to William’s, tells Crying Child to “remember what he saw”. Crying Child 
      also has a large fear of the animatronics. There’s also an empty girl’s room in that same minigame.
</p>
<p>Also bringing in the structure of the animatronics, they appear to be some of the more early versions. So they most likely
     would come first in the timeline.

<p> But there’s no way for Baby or anyone else from her group to exist. Afton has no motive to kill. Why would he be making killer robots? So the question becomes, how would she be the death he saw? </p>

<p> Here are the orginal core four animatronics!</p>
