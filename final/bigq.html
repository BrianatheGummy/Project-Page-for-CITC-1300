    <h2>The Big Questions!</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Is it easy to play?    </h3>
    <p> Overall, yes. The basic computer functions for the mechanics is simple and does not require a lot of effort to use. However, it is to be said that there are some problems with the mechanics of the drone. It can be difficult to operate and can leave the player frustrated on how to use it and can sometimes keep you from being able to move on to the next part. The developers have tried to make this a bit easier, with bosses and chase sequences being slower than they would be in other games, which based on what the games is, the best we can do for now. 
    </p>
    <h3>Is the lore hard to follow?    </h3>
    <p> Depends on what you mean by hard to follow. It’s not Five Nights At Freddy’s level of “hid one lore clue in twenty books”, but it is complicated. Stinger Flynn’s dream sequences, the lore tapes and paper reports, the notes left by the kid are all just the basics to keeping up with this world. It’s a lot, and certainly not something someone should be too stressed about. That’s what this community is for. To help each other understand what we don’t get at first.

    <h3>Is this a horror game?    </h3>
    <p>Well, technically yes, however it is the best game for someone who is just getting into horror games to begin with. It’s a game that has no real violence in it, so for those who cannot stand blood and gore, this is the best one to start out with. If you are an avid horror lover, and just can’t get enough of the darker side of things, this isn’t really your game. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but is something truly fun if it is your kind of horror game.

    </p>
    <h3>Is the story done?    </h3>
    <p>
        Absolutely not. If anything, the story has just begun. Garten of BanBan has many more secrets left to tell, stories to share, and questions to answer. We are currently on game six of who knows how many. But this story isn’t over yet and the world of Garten of BanBan is still expanding.
